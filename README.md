# DeepConPred2
##DeepConPred2 is a local programm that predicts the residue contact map of a target protein from the amino acid sequence. It has 3 modules for different steps of contact prediction and works well on proteins even with limited numbers of homologous sequences. DeepConPred2 could be ranked as one of the state-of-the-art methods in contact prediction according to our tests on different testing sets including the CASP11 and CASP12 sets. We also developed a web server of DeepConPred2.
