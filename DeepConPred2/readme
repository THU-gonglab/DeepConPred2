#INTRODUCTION
DeepConPred2 is a program that predicts contact map of a target protein sequence. It has 3 modules (file folders 'C', 'R' and 'New_Third' in folder 'f_model') for different steps of contact prediction and works well on proteins no matter with or without many sequence homologs. DeepConPred2 could be ranked as one of the state-of-the-art methods in contact prediction according to our tests on different testing sets including CASP11 and CASP12. See the paper for technical details.

#REQUIREMENT
(1) gcc and g++ compilers;
(2) python with tensorflow(version 1.6.0) );

#HOW TO USE
1.Fasta file should be prepared for target protein in the file folder 'data', like file 'T0982' in file fold 'data_example'. Notice that the name of this fasta file must be the name of the target protein.
2.Results of psiblast, ccmpred and Spider3 should be prepared for target protein in the file folder 'data', like files 'T0982.PSSM', 'T0982.ccmpred' and 'T0982.spd33' in file fold 'data_example'.
3.Excute the python script 'DeepConPred2.py' with the name of the target protein. For example, for 'T0982' in file fold 'data_example', 
excute command line 'python DeepConPred2.py T0982'.
4.The final result is a matrix file with suffix '.contactP' and should be found in the file folder 'result', like file 'T0982.contactP' in file fold 'result_example'.
